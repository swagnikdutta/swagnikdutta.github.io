    <h1 id="good-monday-morning">Good monday morning</h1>
<p>This week&rsquo;s primary goal is to complete my native dns resolver. It would be nice to get it done within 3 days.</p>
<p>I like to have secondary projects/todos on the side so that if I hit a roadblock with the first one, there is something else to spend time on. There are couple of things in my mind</p>
<ul>
<li>I can watch Andy Pavlo&rsquo;s lecture on database storage.
<ul>
<li>maybe it can conjure some new project ideas (building a LSM tree?)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I can do some SQL practise everyday for about half an hour</li>
<li>Read further through the first chapter of SICP.</li>
<li>Read further through 100 Go mistakes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Having said that, I would try to dedicate the first three days strictly for my dns resolver.</p>
<h2 id="day-1">Day 1</h2>
<h3 id="toy-dns-resolver">Toy DNS resolver</h3>
<p>Spent most of my daytime reading the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1035#section-4">RFC pages</a>. I took time to understand the structure of the DNS message packet in general and each of its sections and that of Resource Records.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>
    +---------------------+
    |        Header       |
    +---------------------+
    |       Question      | the question for the name server
    +---------------------+
    |        Answer       | RRs answering the question
    +---------------------+
    |      Authority      | RRs pointing toward an authority
    +---------------------+
    |      Additional     | RRs holding additional information
    +---------------------+
    
</code></pre><p>Creating the packet is essentially the first step. Which is followed by serialization of it. That&rsquo;s what I have learnt from implementing ping few weeks ago. Except that, ping was much simpler.</p>
<p>On the coding part I didn&rsquo;t achieve much. I created the types representing the Message and its sections with documentation for each of the fields so that I can avoid switching from Goland to RFC pages frequently.</p>
<h3 id="volunteered-to-use-tcp-implementation-guide-by-julia-evans">Volunteered to use TCP implementation guide by Julia Evans</h3>
<p>At night I volunteered to use Julia Evan&rsquo;s guide to implement TCP in a weekend, which is in alpha right now.</p>
<p>Doing this exercise would mean using the guide to implement TCP in a language of my choice(Go) and report my findings in the process. I feel good about this exercise and it aligns with my goal at RC as well.</p>
<p>Spent sometime reading the code at a high level. I focused on the TCP checksum calculation part which seemed <em>strange</em>. I referred to the TCP <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9293#v4pseudo">RFC pages</a> to learn that checksum calculation in TCP is somewhat differnet. It considers certain informations from the IP header as well which it calls pseudo-header.</p>
<p>Generally, if packet A encapsulates packet B, pakcet A has to consider the entirety of packet B while calculating checksum.
But here it seemed that, packet B was interested in certain information from packet A&rsquo;s header.</p>
<p>Called it a night!</p>
